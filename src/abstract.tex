\noindent The present volume, \textit{Essentials of Stochastic Process}, is
an English translation of my book written in Japanese and issued by Iwanami
Shoten in 1957 in two parts: Stochastic Processes I and II. In this  work, I
provide a unified and comprehensive account of additive processes, stationary processes, and Markov processes, which remain to this day the three most important classes of stochastic processes.\\\\
